# Digital-Clock
A simple and responsive digital clock built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays the current time in real-time, updating every second, and is designed with a clean UI. It helped me practice JavaScriptâ€™s Date object, DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS Flexbox and animations.
